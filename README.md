unhackathon-storytime
=====================

After a long weekend of hacking, who wouldn't want to curl up and listen to a good story? You would, right? Well, you're out of luck. 

Now, if it's *bad* stories you're looking for...

(Unhackathon Storytime automatically generates a new silly story every time it's loaded by filling in the blanks of the template provided with random words. Think Mad Libs, only you don't get to pick what words get filled in. Check out http://youhackwith.me for an example.)

Built with web.py for gits and shiggles.
